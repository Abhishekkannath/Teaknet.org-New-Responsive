        <h4>Services offered by TEAKNET</h4>
        <p class="mt-4">
          <strong>TEAKNET </strong>is an international network of institutions  and  individuals  interested  in teak. <strong>TEAKNET </strong> addresses the interests of all the categories of stakeholders related to teak, whether they are growers, traders, researchers or other groups with a profound interest or concerned with teak. From time to time, the organization formulates action plans focusing on the short term and long term needs of the global teak sector. Success of the network is critically dependent on wider participation, by all those concerned with conservation, management and utilization of teak. TEAKNET is basically manned by an international Steering Committee and its headquarters is currently located at the Kerala Forest Research Institute at Peechi, India which acts as the host institution for the functioning of <strong>TEAKNET </strong>
          The secretariat of <strong>TEAKNET </strong>
          was established at KFRI using the funds from FAO of the United Nations. After the establishment of the secretariat, a website has been developed which provides information on several aspects related to teak. Institutions or individuals can register themselves free of cost in the website and get access to the information provided therein. The website provides directory of teak researchers, growers and traders and is viewable by all registered users. An electronic newsletter is also available for browsing in the website. <br><br>

 

          Membership of TEAKNET is open to individuals and institutions on an annual basis with payment of a fee. Members are entitled to present their requirements with respect to any information they need regarding teak, to the secretariat. The secretariat maintains an information centre wherein available literature on teak is stored. The information requested will be supplied to the extent available. Such information may include not only scientific information but also that of interest to traders like availability and price of teakwood, plantations or products from teakwood. Additionally, it is planned to develop an international database on global teak resources which will be hosted in the website and will also form the basis of many scientific studies later. Members will also be eligible to communicate their felt needs with regard to any issue or problem which TEAKNET could possibly handle. <br><br>
          
           
          
          Conducting periodical meetings of the members is another distinct activity undertaken by TEAKNET. The meetings could be at national, regional or international levels. TEAKNET identifies Country Coordinators for the purpose from among the members. National meetings are organized with the help of Country Coordinators. Expenses towards attending such meetings will have to be borne by the members but certain basic hospitality will be offered by TEAKNET using the subscription funds or donor contributions. Members will have the privilege to present and discuss common issues of their interest and suggest action plans leading to the solutions. TEAKNET could arrange to send resolutions from such meetings to the concerned on behalf of the members.<br><br>
          
           
          
          As part of a long term strategy, TEAKNET plans to provide research support, training or consultancy services for any topical issues concerned with teak. TEAKNET would make deliberate attempts to generate funds for such purposes by approaching donor agencies across the globe.<br><br>
          
           
          
          Exchange of materials is yet another service that is thought of but will be subject to all the international regulations involved.<br><br>
