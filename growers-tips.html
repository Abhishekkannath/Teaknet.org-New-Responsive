       <h5 class="mt-5">Question from Roderic Evers, Managing Director, Future Forests Fiji</h5>
       <p>Fiji is well known for its sandalwood. I have some questions which perhaps one of the researchers at KFRI can answer.</p>
       <ol class="ml-4">
        <li> Is there any research available on intercropping teak with sandalwood?</li>
        <li>Could teak be a host to sandalwood?</li>
        <li>  Is sandalwood shade tolerant?</li>
        <li> Will sandalwood compete with teak for nutrients in the soils?</li>
      </ol>
      <h5 class="mt-5">Answer from Dr. R.C. Pandalai, Silviculturist, KFRI</h5>
      <p>Inter cropping of teak with sandal has not been experimented till date. However there are reports that pot culture experiments showed good growth of sandal in association with teak as a host with good haustorial connections (Ananthapadmanabaha et al.1980). Field experiments by Rama Rao (1911) has shown that sandal attacks roots of almost all plants but it shows decided preference and grows best in the company of certain species. The order of preference is Pongamia pinnata, Albizia lebbeck and Tectona grandis. He has also opined that it will be very difficult to differentiate good and bad hosts of sandal from field observations. A brochure on sandal by the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education, Dehradun will be worth referring.</p>


      <h5 class="mt-5">From the above references, teak could be a host to sandalwood.</h5>
      <p>Sandal needs very good, overhead light for better growth, crown development and high oil yield. There are also reports that sandal grows well as an undercrop in teak. As per our personal observations sandal may grow under shade with very poor vigor and probably with meager oil production.</p>
      <p>Sandal being a root parasite, there is no question of competing with teak for nutrients. Sandal may draw nutrients from teak if it strikes an association with teak.</p>

      <h5 class="mt-5">Question from Murray Keys and Roderic Evers, Future Forests Fiji</h5>
      <p>It is learnt that there are significant differences in the root systems between seedlings with a well developed early age taproot and cuttings which develop a more distributed root system with lateral roots and sink roots. We would like to know if there is evidence that this root structure difference causes a lack of wind-firmness in the young teak plantations established with cuttings.  Here in Fiji, the area is frequently hit by severe winds caused by tropical cyclones, so a significant loss of wind stability would impact on the usefulness of cuttings in propagation.</p>

        <h5 class="mt-5">Answer from Dr. R.C. Pandalai, Silviculturist, KFRI</h5>
      <p>It is true that there are significant differences between the root systems of seedlings and cuttings,("stumps"). However as you have rightly stated, stumps will have more distributed root system with strong lateral and peripheral roots and this will not cause any problem of lack of wind- firmness during the early stages of plantation establishment. On the other hand, from our experience we can say that the stumps are more suited to wind prone areas and conditions prevailing in Fiji.</p>
      <p>It is but a known fact that the teak is a surface rooter and it looses the lower portions of its tap root in course of time, say 10 to 15 years. However since teak has a well spread surface root mesh-work, the tree will not be easily toppled down by wind. More over, when we are planting teak in a 2 m X 2 m spacing or even closer (High Density Plantations) especially during the early stages of establishment (Later we may have to do the usual mechanical/silvicultural thinning for allowing more light for the developing trees), the root mesh-work anchors the plant very well and takes care of the wind problem. Another precautionary measure you may probably think of is planting a shelter belt/wind break plantation with appropriate species (Casuarinas?) around the teak plantation.</p>
      <p>What ever be the type of propagule we use for planting, teak looses a functional tap root over a period of time and it is the mesh of surface roots that holds and feeds teak in later part of its life cycle.</p>
