The Review reports on production, trade and prices for primary wood products (industrial roundwood, sawnwood, veneer and plywood); trade and prices for secondary processed wood products (SPWPs); major traded tropical wood species; and directions of trade for primary tropical wood products. The latest edition of the Review features a comprehensive case study on the plywood industry in China, which has become one of the world’s biggest plywood producers. </p>

            <p class="card-text">Teak (Tectona grandis L.f.) is one of the most valuable tropical hardwoods of the world. Together with other high-grade hardwoods, teak is sought in the global markets for its beauty, strength and stability, natural resistance and wide array of applications ranging from quality furniture through interior joinery to cultural uses. Given the importance of teak, a group of experts from IUFRO, FAO and TEAKNET conducted a global teak study addressing best practices and lessons learned on the conservation of teak genetic resources and the sustainable management of teak forests in Africa, Asia and Latin America.  </p>

            <p class="card-text">Lao PDR has an estimated resource of 40,000 ha of plantation teak, 26,000 ha of which is grown by smallholders in the north. This resource is maturing and becoming of commercial interest to wood industries within Lao PDR and its neighbours China, Vietnam and Thailand and the more distant markets of India. To make best use of their resource, Lao stakeholders must be familiar with the broader international markets, both in regards to demand and access requirements, as part of decision making processes. Without knowledge of market drivers, prices and trends, policy makers, managers and smallholder growers are at a disadvantage. Conclusions are </p>

Topics covered in the book include the status and current trends of natural and planted teak forests, the selection of planting sites, propagation and nursery techniques, silviculture and plantation management, harvesting, wood characteristics and processing, financial issues and environmental impacts.Superior planting stock in the form of genetic clones developed for specific environmental conditions; along with modern management techniques have transformed it into a champion producer of high quality wood with a very bright future. Unfortunately, too many plantations still do not take advantage of these greatly improved opportunities.</p>
