        <a  href=""><h4>Worldwide translocation of teak - origin of landraces and present genetic base</h4></a>
        <p class="my-4">Teak (Tectona grandis Linn. f.) is one of the major plantation timbers of the world. The species is native to India, Myanmar, Thailand and Laos in South East Asia but was translocated to several countries in Africa and Central and South America during the past century. Today, large areas of plantations are grown outside the species native range. It is speculated that genetic bottlenecks and founder effects combined with new selection pressures under new growing conditions have led to the formation of distinct landraces; this hypothesis is supported by results from international provenance tests. In the present study, we apply genetic markers to identify the likely origin of teak grown outside its native range and examine if the landraces show signs of reduced genetic diversity. We find large variation in the level of diversity among landraces, although not larger than that observed among native populations. </p>

        <p class="my-4">FAO. 2015. Global teak trade in the aftermath of Myanmar’s log export ban by Kollert, W. & Walotek, P.J. Planted Forests and Trees Working Paper FP/49/E. Rome, Italy. Myanmar is a teak heavyweight, playing a significant role in the global teak trade. It has the largest area of natural teak forests (almost 50 percent of 29 million ha globally) and is the number one producer of teak logs in the world. Its natural forests produce about a quarter of the globally reported teak log supply, including good-quality teak that sells at comparatively high prices. In the observed period, the prices of quality teak logs from Myanmar and plantation teak logs from Africa and Latin America showed an upward trend of 3–4.5 percent a year on average. However, the markets and prices for these products are fundamentally different</p>

        <p class="my-4">The aim of this study is to select “Plus Trees” based on dendrometric characteristics and wood properties in teak plantations in Benin and Togo. For this purpose, growth performance was assessed in 569 trees in 5 forests in Togo and 90 trees in 3 forests in Benin, based on diameter at breast height, total height and bole height measurements. Wood properties – density, percentage of heartwood and colour – were also measured for the final selection of Plus trees. This study enables to determine the main performances of teak in different forests reserves in Togo and Benin. The next step will be the multiplication of these 25 Plus trees. Improved performance of plantations will be secured by these new genetic resources for the reforestation activities in Togo and Benin.</p>

        <p class="my-4">Teak (Tectona grandis L.f.) is an important species in the worldwide quality tropical hardwood sector, whichhas gained significance in Central America since the first large plantations were established in the 1980s. The present work is a descriptive study that aims to: (1) analyse and characterise the general soil patterns which may be influencing teak plantations in Central America; (2) assess differences between countries and sub-regions; (3) create a global framework to help contextualise the soil fertility analyses conducted at sub-regional or farm level, and (4) determine the main problems associated with soil fertility in the region. </p>

        <p class="my-4">High rates of soil loss are usually assumed under teak (Tectona grandis L.f.) plantations and some debate has been created about this during recent years. This paper analyzed the processes of soil loss and accumulation in a case study and performed a critical review of literature from other studies, due to the shortage of field experimental data from around the world.</p>
